# ODU Call Center
 Created a call center management system using Twilio tools and a toll free number for Old Dominion University
 
- I am thrilled to announce the successful completion of my project, developed as part of the Human 
 Computer Interaction course during my master's program at Old Dominion University. 
- The primary objective of the project was to create a call center management system using contact flow 
 within the Twilio platform. 
- This comprehensive system encompasses various services aimed at enhancing communication and 
 accessibility for students. 
- By leveraging the capabilities of Twilio, the project enables users to connect with different professors 
 within the college by simply pressing DTMF (Dual Tone Multi-Frequency) buttons on their phones. 
- Students can conveniently access information such as office hours for specific professors, schedule 
 appointments with the student health services for any health-related concerns, and gather valuable 
 insights about various departments and colleges present within the university. 
- By utilizing a toll-free number obtained through Twilio, this project effectively provides students with a 
 centralized resource to access important information vital to their academic journey.
